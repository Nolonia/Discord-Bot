## About

You can invite her to your Discord server using [this](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=839436962057551892&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2F7CgzRGCUvC&response_type=code&scope=guilds.join%20bot) link!

## Installation

You can add Calypso to your server with [this](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=839436962057551892&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2F7CgzRGCUvC&response_type=code&scope=guilds.join%20bot) link! Alternatively, you can clone this repo and host the bot yourself.
```
git clone https://github.com/Nolonia/Nolonia.git
```
After cloning, run an
```
npm install aoi.js
```
to snag all of the dependencies. Of course, you need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. I also strongly recommend [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aoi.js) as it makes testing *much* easier.

## Setting Up

You have to edit a `nolonia.js` file in order to run the bot. Your file should look something like this:
```
const Aoijs = require("aoi.js")
 
const bot = new Aoijs.Bot({
  mobile: false,
  token: "TOKEN", //Add here your bot token!
  prefix: ["PREFIX"] //Type your prefix here
  autoUpdate: true, 
  
})
```
Visit the Discord [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) to create an app and use the client token you are given for the `token` option.

After your `nolonia.js` file is built, you have enable `Privileged Intents` on your Discord [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). You can find these intents under the "Bot" section, and there are two ticks you have to switch on. For more information on Gateway Intents, check out [this](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/intents.html#the-intents-bit-field-wrapper) link.

Once done, feel free to launch Nolonia using the command `node nolonia.js`. If on Linux, you can also kick off using the `start.sh` script. If you need additional help setting up, join the [Nolonia Support Server](https://discord.gg/7CgzRGCUvC)!
